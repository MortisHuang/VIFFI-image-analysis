Data format: 16bit monochromatic TIFF
Base line is 100.
File name format: (original .FIRE file name)-(channel number)-(image index)

white blood cells
ch1: cytoplasm (cell body)
ch2: nucleus
lymphocyte: smaller circular nucleus
neutrophyl: larger lobulated nucleus

Euglena
ch1: lipid
ch2: chlorophyll
N+: nitrogen sufficient
N-: nitrogen deficient

Lipid images consist of bright lipid droplets and dim cell body due to the lipid membrane.

Crosstalk compensation (mutural subtraction of image data between the two channels) may be helpful for better segmentation results.
